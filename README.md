A modular .NET library for observable, lockable, and defaultable properties with hierarchical overrides, reactive updates, and thread-safe access patterns.  

Features:  
- **Observable properties** with subscription-based change notifications  
- **Thread-safe locking** with scope-based synchronization  
- **Default values** and restore functionality
